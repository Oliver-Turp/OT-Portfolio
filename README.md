# Portfolio of Work Done, Fully Complete or Otherwise

#### Note, Some Work Is Incomplete For A Variety of Reasons, Usually Revolving Around CLients Leaving The Project. These Are Included As A Website UI Example.

# To-Do List:

- [x] Create An Overall Nav System.
- [x] Group Unfinished Designs Into "UI Examples" Or Something Positive.
- [x] ~~Have a home button absolutely positioned in the corner of all pages without the default Nav.~~ Went new tab route instead
- [x] Include A Bio. Use https://anthonyconstant.co.uk and https://robertd.co.uk/ as references.
- [x] ~~Sources Light/Dark Images For The Home Page. Coding Related? Tech Related? Abstract Patterns? Something Trippy?~~ Attempting to get custom art done.
- [ ] Media Queries For All Pages! INCLUDING UI EXAMPLES!
- [x] Add a 'services' page? Maybe too money grabby as prices vary. Could use a 'from $x' method? Either way what would I offer? I'm only really good with static sites. Lists of 1 aren't good to look at.
- [ ] ~~See if Sam wants to make graphic wallpaper for the projects bg~~ He wouldn't do it. ET may help instead
- [ ] ~~See if Sam would always make me a logo around my initials. This can be converted to a favicon too.~~ He wouldn't do it. ET may help instead
- [x] Finish & Upload My CV as PDF
- [x] Scan & Upload My Degree
- [ ] Create Images For Project Cards
- [x] Contact MailTo
- [x] Contact Form
- [x] Theme Static
- [x] Theme Toggle
- [ ] Link Eli Turp When Finished
- [ ] Link Fifa Project When Finished
- [ ] ~~Link Rainy's Site When Finished~~
- [ ] Switch Projects File to mongoDB. That way I only ever need to update the DB and never rebuild the site to make changes!
- [ ] Add Certificates To About Section? Need something to break up the text
- [ ] Prerender large image files
- [ ] Permanent content for the error page? Or something comical and an auto-redirect backwards? 
- [ ] Services page -> Remove prices. Have breakdown explanation of what the services are and the difference between each tier. These then autofill like before into a contact form. This form either has Q&A boxes with specific questions or a general more details text area. Request for quote button submits form via emailJS

The code that sets how long the jwt lasts is located in [adminAuthController.js](./backend/controllers/adminAuthController.js#generateToken)  inside it's `generateToken` method. The line that says 
```js
// { expiresIn: "2d" }   => expires in 2days (30d => 30days)
return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "2d" } );
```
